FEATURES:  
1. Basic UI
2. Movement and collsions
3. Nearly 15 minutes long gameplay
4. Saving highscore

CONCEPTS OF SYLLABUS USED:  
1. Python basics
2. Recursion
3. Importing modules
4. Functions
5. File handling
6. 2-Dimensional arrays
7. Error handling

CLARIFICATION:  
This is an original project, and is not 'copy-pasted'. Help was taken from the internet to note basic tkinter
functions.

Searching for pyRager on google only gives the result of some Reddit user. This project is not related to that
person in any way.

MODULES USED:  
1. tkinter (based heavily on it, installed on standard python. If not, reinstall python with tcl/tk selected)
2. random (Used for starting quotes)
3. winsound (only for Windows, error handling used if not found)
4. math (only used once for fabs() and pow() functions)

SOFTWARE USED:  
1. IDLE
2. Paint.net(since ms paint doesnt support transparent images)  https://www.getpaint.net/index.html
3. BFXR(Free software to generate algorithm driven sounds)  https://www.bfxr.net/

I have tried to explain by comments all the tkinter functions used.
Further help can be taken from http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/ and
